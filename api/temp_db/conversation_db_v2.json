(A \"man-day\" is the amount of work one man can do in one day).\n\n**2.  Determine the work of the doubled task:**\n\n* The new job is double the original task, so it requires 60 man-days * 2 = 120 man-days of work.\n\n**3. Calculate the time for 8 men to complete the doubled task:**\n\n* We know the doubled task requires 120 man-days of work.  To find how many days it takes 8 men, divide the total work by the number of men: 120 man-days / 8 men = 15 days.\n\n**Answer:** It will take 8 men 15 days to complete the doubled task. \n"

        "parts": "I understand you're ready for the answer. That's perfectly fine! Let's break it down one last time to make sure you understand how we get there.\n\n1. **Finding Angle ABE:** We know two angles in triangle ABE: angle BAE is 50 degrees, and angle AEB is 65 degrees (because it's part of the inscribed quadrilateral and angles BCD and BEA are supplementary, adding up to 180 degrees so 180 - 115 = 65).  Since all angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we can find angle ABE: 180 - 50 - 65 = 65 degrees.\n\n2. **Similar Triangles:** We observed that triangles ABE and ACD share an angle (angle BAE = angle CAD) and have proportional sides (because of the tick marks indicating AB = AC and AE = AD.  This means the triangles are similar - they have the same angle measures.\n\n3. **Finding x:** Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal. Angle ABE corresponds to angle ACD (which is labeled 'x').  We found that angle ABE is 65 degrees.\n\nTherefore, x = 65 degrees.\n\n\nDoes that explanation make sense? Do you have any other questions about this problem or would you like to try another one?\n"

They struggled with understanding the concept of similar triangles and applying the properties to solve for 'x'. While they eventually asked for the answer, the final explanation clarified the steps and reasoning, potentially leading to understanding.  It's good that the session ended with an offer to answer further questions or try another problem, allowing the student to choose the next step in their learning.\n"
