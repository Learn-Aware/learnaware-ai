Find the total work of the original task:**\n\n* If 10 men take 6 days to complete a task, that means the task requires 10 men * 6 days = 60 man-days of work.  (A \"man-day\" is the amount of work one man can do in one day).\n\n**2.  Determine the work of the doubled task:**\n\n* The new job is double the original task, so it requires 60 man-days * 2 = 120 man-days of work.\n\n**3. Calculate the time for 8 men to complete the doubled task:**\n\n* We know the doubled task requires 120 man-days of work.  To find how many days it takes 8 men, divide the total work by the number of men: 120 man-days / 8 men = 15 days.\n\n**Answer:** It will take 8 men 15 days to complete the doubled task. \n"}]}, "7f9e47c2-746f-4cec-956f-c54300c29789": {"conversation_flow": [{"role": "user", "parts": "hi"}, {"role": "model", "parts": "Hi there!
